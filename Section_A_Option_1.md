Section A:
Option 1, Python Task:

In regards to this student's script's style, on line 2 there is a slight indentation issue.
With line 2 being indented further to the right than line 3 is, the following code within 
the function will be unreachable, so having correct indentation will allow for the
code in the function to be reachable.

Another small styling issue would be the name of the function. Although it would not effect 
the execution of the code, python naming conventions recommend that when naming a function 
the name should be in all lowercase and should have underscores seperating the words. So, 
the name of the function should be "group_anagrams".

The last styling issue is a rather small one, which is that there should be two line spaces 
after a class or a function. So there should be two extra line spaces between line 10 and 11.

For ease of editing, what the student could do is take the list that is being parse from line 12
and have it defined as its own variable and have that variable passed to the function. This will 
allow for the list to be predifined before being parsed into the "Solution" function. 

In regards to correctness, there is an error in line 5. The student simply forgot to put 
the variable "i" into the sorted function. Simply adding that variable will allow for the
script to run.

The student's sorting algorithm is designed in a very efficient manner, everything has been 
written in a short and concise manner showing the student's good understanding of working with 
lists/arrays. The student setting up the function to return a value rather than print is also 
the better way to format the function.
